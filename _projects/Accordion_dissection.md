For this project we were given the task to dissect and take apart an accordion to understand the fluid dynamics of the system. We measured dimentions from the given accordion to create a CAD model of the system to show how each part works. In the video we discribed how air travels through the reed blocks. By opening and closing different reeds the accordion can create different sounds. We can find the change it pressure and flow rate to find how loud or what pitch the cord is.
